PaintSwap GUI Task:
Create a simple webpage/app and host it for free on github pages. No need for a domain name, can use the format https://user.github.io/my-app. Estimated effort: 1 to 4 hours.
 
Content:
1. A header that says "Calculator"
2. Two input fields (A and B) to type in numbers
3. Something to select an arithmetic operator for the numbers: plus(+), minus(-), multi(*), div(/)
4. Two buttons (Calc and Clear)
5. A nice dynamic chart OR table of your choice that will display the result
 
Function:
1. The calc button will calculate the result based on A <operator> B. Then plot the result (Y-value if using a chart). The other parameter is time (date format as "Feb 24, 2024") and for each press of the button a new data point will be added which will also increase the timestamp by one day. 5 + 2 => button adds value 7 at today's date (next press => tomorrow), and so on.
2. The clear button will reset and clear everything
 
Design requirements:
1. Some kind of background: Solid, gradient, pattern or image
2. Fully responsive design ie. look good on any screen size (including the chart/table)
 
Other rules:
1. Use any programming language you want
2. Getting help from AI is allowed, but you need to understand all the code in case we ask something specific
3. No need for a server to store data values, it can be stored in memory only or in browser local storage. It doesn't matter if the data is reset on page refresh, your choice
4. The page/app must be hosted on Github pages
5. Deadline for the task: End of Tuesday UTC (May 7, 23:59:59)
 
When done:
Send a link to display the webpage to Paintoshi
 
Criteria:
We will look at pure design choice, colors, placement, alignment, responsive design, functionality, bugs, code structure
